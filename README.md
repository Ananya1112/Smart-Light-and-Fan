# Smart-Light-and-Fan

This project consists of an arduinoIDE code which will be helpful in making smart light and fan.

## Smart Light:

The smart light can be controlled by a Blynk app. Their intensity can be regulated and they can be 
turned on/off through an app. Also, we have provided a LDR sensor which can detect the surrounding lights
and regulate the intensity of the light accordingly. We have also integrated the voice control feature by which the lights can be controlled by mere voice commands.

## Smart Fan:

The smart Fan can also be turned on/off by an app. It has been equipped with a temperature sensor( DHT - 11) through which it can sense the surrounding temperaute can regulate the speed of the fan accordingly. Moreover, the fan can also be controlled by vice commands.
